# How to install Psyched

You can run Psyched directly from this folder:

	./psyched

If you wish to install psyched for more than one user, or you
need to run psyched without being in the psyched directory,
build & install psyched:

	make
	sudo make install

Unless your distribution changed the paths where components of
Psyched are installed, psyched should install these files:

/usr/bin/psyched
/usr/lib/psyched/psyched_backend.py
/usr/lib/psyched/psyched_strings.py
/usr/lib/psyched/psyched_validate.py
/usr/share/applications/psyched.desktop
/usr/share/pixmaps/psyched.png
