Psyched is a simple, fast scheduling application for planning your life.
It is task and appointment based, with operations for adding,
modifying, deleting and rescheduling both tasks and appointments.

installed on your system.

	I need to fill this in, there are some complexities here.

Releasing: Run Tests
--------

Run the manual and automatic tests.

To run the automatic tests (coverage is pretty low at this point):

	nosetests -v tests

To run the manual tests, perform these tasks:

* Move your .psyched directory and check that basic program startup works OK.
* Try adding and removing a few tasks and schedule items.
* Create a task and a schedule item and make sure that the alerts work as expected.

Files
-------------------

Psyched stores data in ~/.psyched/psyched.db.  No other files are
written on disk during normal program operation.
